# Morris-Worm-Seed-Lab
## Introduction

This repository contains the Morris Worm Seed Lab, which is designed to help students understand the Morris Worm, one of the first computer worms distributed via the Internet. The lab provides hands-on experience in analyzing and understanding the worm's behavior and its impact on computer security.

## Lab Objectives

- Understand the historical significance of the Morris Worm.
- Analyze the code and behavior of the Morris Worm.
- Learn about the vulnerabilities exploited by the worm.
- Explore the impact of the worm on computer security practices.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of computer networks and security.
- Familiarity with Unix/Linux operating systems.
- Understanding of programming concepts in C.

## Lab Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Joshua-Ludolf/Morris-Worm-Seed-Lab.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the lab directory:
    ```bash
    cd Morris-Worm-Seed-Lab
    ```
